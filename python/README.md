## Overview

These examples show how to integrate Google Protocol Buffers with Ice for Python.

Ice supports metadata that makes it possible for you to specify
Protocol Buffers message types in your Slice definitions, with Ice
handling the serialization chores for you automatically. The metadata,
which may only be used on a sequence<byte> type, has the following
syntax in Python:

  ```
  python:protobuf:protoc-generated-class
  ```

For example:

  ```
  ["python:protobuf:Person_pb2.Person"] sequence<byte> Person;
  ```

The type name specified in this example, Person_pb2.Person,
corresponds to the Python class generated by the Protocol Buffers
compiler (protoc) for the definition shown below:

  ```
  package tutorial;
  message Person { ... };
  ```

## Prerequisites

You'll need to install Ice for Python in order to use any of the sample programs.
Our [documentation][1] describes how to install the Python packages.


## Running the Demo

Prior to running the demo, you must generate the Python code for
Person.proto by running the following command in the `demo` directory:

  ```
  $ protoc --python_out=. Person.proto
  ```

To run the demo, first from the `demo` directory start the server:

  ```
  $ python Server.py
  ```

In a separate window, start the client:

  ```
  $ python Client.py
  ```

## Running the Test

To run the test, change to the `test` directory and run the python script found there.

  ```
  $ cd test
  $ python run.py
  ```
